# File-Splitter
A tool that helps you split big files. / 一个帮您切割文件的工具

# What?
This tool helps you split a big file into small pieces for easy storage and transfer.
We also helps you mix them all up into the original file.
There is a consoled version and a windowed version, the **windowed version** is recommended.

# How to use?
The consoled version has a built-in doc, so read it.
The windowed version is easy to understand (i believe), so do it.

*fact : I'm too lazy to write docs :)*

# ps
My code may looks quite ugly, but it is actually really ugly and probably not in Java standard...
